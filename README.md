This is greengrep - a greentext search engine.
Based off of memegrep.com, which I really like.

The plan is simple
- Scrape reddit or some other website
- Generate embeddings (and possibly OCR too?)
- Store in postgres
- Return search based on similarity

[Here's](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/extensions/pgvector) a quick guide I can use.
